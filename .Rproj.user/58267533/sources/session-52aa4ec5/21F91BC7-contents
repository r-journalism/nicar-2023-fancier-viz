You can follow along with the `ggtext.qmd` file in the **nicar-2023-fancier-viz** project folder that you downloaded in the [**First steps**](data_prep.html) link.

If you've downloaded the appropriate data files and put them in a data folder, you can just copy and paste all the code in the gray boxes in an R script.

We're going to try a package called **ggtext**. This will allow us to change the formats of text in our ggplot2 graphics with html code!

Type out or copy and paste all the code in all the gray sections below in your own script or console or run the chunks as they appear in the `ggtext.qmd` file.

Let's load the libraries, import the state-level data and see the structure of the data we've imported.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE


library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)

state_df <- read_csv("data/opioids_states.csv")
```

Seems familiar!

Let's look only at Tennessee.

We'll use the ggplot2 function `scale_color_manual()` to change the colors of the `geom_line()`

```{r }
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

p <- state_df %>% 
  filter(state=="Tennessee") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, color=type)) +
    scale_color_manual(
    values = c(death_per_1m = "#0072B2", pills_per_person = "#D55E00")
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  labs(title="Rates of opioid purchases and deaths in Tennessee",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Rate")

p
```
This is fine, but let's try to make it publication-ready.

First, let's get rid of the legends at the bottom and incorporate the colors into a subtitle.

And we're going to use a function from **ggtext** called [`element_markdown()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/reference/element_markdown.html) within the `theme()` function from **ggplot2**.

It's an alternative to `element_text()` which is the usual way to modify how the text is rendered in a plot-- like font and height and color. but `element_markdown()` adds oomph to it. This will allow us to pass html code into the text and have it rendered!


```{r }
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE

p <- state_df %>% 
  filter(state=="Tennessee") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, color=type)) +
    scale_color_manual(
    values = c(death_per_1m = "#0072B2", pills_per_person = "#D55E00"),
    guide="none"
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  # don't need this anymore
  # theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  theme_minimal() +
# This is new: element_markdown()
  theme(
    text= element_text(family = "Times"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.title= element_markdown(size=11, lineheight = 1.2)
  ) +
# Everything can go into title along with html code
  labs(title = "<strong>Rates of opioid purchases and deaths in Tennessee</strong><br>
<span style = 'font-size:10pt;'>The annual increase in the sale of <span style = 'color:#0072B2;'>opioid pills per person</span> corresponded with the increase <br />in <span style = 'color:#D55E00;'>overdose deaths per million residents</span> until 2011 when sales declined while deaths kept increasing.",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Rate")
p
```

       x = "Year",

       caption= "Data: CDC and The Washington Post DEA ARCOS api"
  ) +
  geom_richtext(aes(x=2012, y=80, 
                    #lineheight=.5,
                    angle = -10,
                    label="<span style = 'font-size:8pt'>

Excellent!
