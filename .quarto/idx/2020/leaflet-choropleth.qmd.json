The term you hear most frequently are \"shapefiles\" but they could also be GeoJSONs, or TopoJSON, or KML, or even KMZ files, among others.\n\n## Basics\n\nThere are two underlying important pieces of information for spatial data:\n\n* Coordinates of the object\n* How the coordinates relate to a physical location on Earth\n    * Also known as coordinate reference system or **CRS**\n\n## CRS\n\n* Geographic \n    * Uses three-dimensional model of the earth to define specific locations on the surface of the grid\n    * longitude (East/West) and latitude (North/South)\n* Projected\n    * A translation of the three-dimensional grid onto a two-dimensional plane\n    \n## Raster versus Vector data\n\nSpatial data with a defined CRS can either be vector or raster data.\n\n* Vector (Think Mapbox)\n    * Based on points that can be connected to form lines and polygons\n    * Located with in a coordinate reference system\n    * Example: Road map\n* Raster (Think Google Maps and Leaflet)\n    * Are values within a grid system\n    * Example: Satellite imagery\n\n## sf vs sp\n\n* An older package, **sp**, lets a user handle both vector and raster data.\n* This class will focus on vector data and the **sf** package. \n\n````\nIt also takes much more effort to get your system ready for it (*shakes fist at gdal*). The main differences between the **sp** and **sf** packages are how they store CRS information. While **sp** uses spatial sub classes, **sf** stores data in data frames, allowing it to interact with **dplyr** methods we've learned so far. I encourage you to check out other spatial data analysis and modeling [classes](https://www.rspatial.org/) if you remain interested in this afterward.</aside>\n```\n\n## Shape files\n\nThough we refer to a shape file in the singular, it's actually a collection of at least three basic files: \n\n* .shp - lists shape and vertices\n* .shx - has index with offsets\n* .dbf - relationship file between geometry and attributes (data)\n\nAll files must be present in the directory and named the same (except for the file extension) to import correctly.\n\n```\nR can handle importing different kinds of file formats for spatial data, including KML and geojson and even topojson. We'll focus on shape files, which was created by ESRI in the '90s.\n```\n\n## The plan\n\n1. Map blank shape file we have already downloaded and is on the local machine\n2. Download opioid pain pill data for Louisiana via the [arcos](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/) api \n3. Map data to blank shape file and map results\n\nWe can use **magrittr** `%>%` pipes because the **leaflet** package developers incorporated its function structure. We need three functions starting out:\n\n* `leaflet()` - initializes the leaflet function\n* `addTiles()` - the underlying map tiles\n* `addPolygons()` - instead of dots, we're adding Polygons, or shapes\n    * Passing the argument `popup` to the function with the variable *NAME* from the shape file\n    \n\n```{r loading_packages, warning=F, message=F}\n# This function checks if you don't have the correct packages installed yet\n# If not, it will install it for you\npackages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"readr\", \"httpuv\",\n              \"leaflet\", \"sf\", \"tigris\", \"arcos\",\n              \"sp\", \"rmapshaper\")\nif (length(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages()))) > 0) {\n  install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())), repos = \"https://cran.us.r-project.org\")  \n}\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(arcos)\nlibrary(tigris)\n```\n\n### Importing shapefiles from the Census\n\nThere are more packages that people are producing in R that will pull polygons straight into R. For example, there's an R package called [**Tigris**](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) that pulls from the Census TIGER shapefiles ftp server.\n\nI've already downloaded the files to a folder called **shapefiles**. If you've downloaded the walkthrough files to your computer, they're stored locally.\n\n### Importing shapefiles from your computer\n\n```{r choropleth1, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}\n# importing in the shapefile\ncounties <- st_read(\"shapefiles/us_counties.shp\")\n```\n\n## Visualizing the shapefile \n\n```{r viz_states, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, eval=F}\ncounties %>% \n  leaflet() %>% \n  addTiles() %>% \n  addPolygons(popup=~NAME)\n```\n\n![](images/counties_map.png)\n\nThis is how it looks raw. The Census shape files also include territories, like Guam and Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen mapping, we'll have to remember to exclude them if they show up.\n\n## Joining data to a shapefile\n\n**Let's make a choropleth map based on number of opioids sold per state.**\n\nThis data is pulled and transformed from the [arcos api](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/).\n\n```{r sb_chor, warning=F, message=F}\nannual_summary <- read_csv(\"data/county_pill_summary.csv\")\n\n# If you'd like to build the data above from scratch\n# using the arcos api, uncomment and run the lines below\n\n#annual_counties <- summarized_county_annual(key=\"WaPo\")\n#annual_population <- county_population(key = \"WaPo\")\n#annual <- left_join(annual_counties, annual_population)\n#annual <- annual %>% \n#  mutate(pills_per_person=round(DOSAGE_UNIT/population,2))\n\n\n#annual_summary <- annual %>% \n#  group_by(BUYER_COUNTY, BUYER_STATE, countyfips) %>% \n#  summarize(avg_pills_per_person=round(mean(pills_per_person, na.rm=T),2))\n\nglimpse(annual_summary)\n```\n\nThat's some interesting looking data. \n\n**Tigris** includes a useful function called `geo_join()` to bring together shape files and data frames. You may have used **dplyr** joins before, but `geo_join()` lets you join to non dataframe shape files.\n\nWe'll also use a **leaflet** function called `colorNumeric()` that will turn the continuous variable of numbers of stores into a categorical variable by dividing it into bins and assigning it a hue of color we want. In this instance: Greens. Because, obviously.\n\nAlso setting up a separate array of pop up text for the map.\n\n```{r tigris_join, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, warning=F, message=F}\n# Now we use the Tigris function geo_join to bring together \n# the states shapefile and the sb_states dataframe -- GEOID and countyfips\n# are the two columns they'll be joined by\n\ncounties_merged_annual <- geo_join(counties, annual_summary, \"GEOID\", \"countyfips\")\n\n\n# Getting rid of rows with NA values\n# Using the Base R method of filtering subset() because we're dealing with a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame and not a normal data frame, thus filter() wouldn't work\n\ncounties_merged_annual <- subset(counties_merged_annual, !is.na(avg_pills_per_person))\n\npal <- colorNumeric(\"Greens\", domain=counties_merged_annual$avg_pills_per_person)\n\n# Setting up the popup text\npopup_sb <- paste0(counties_merged_annual$BUYER_COUNTY, \", \", counties_merged_annual$BUYER_STATE, \"</br/> Average pills per person: \\n\", as.character(counties_merged_annual$avg_pills_per_person))\n```\n\nNext, the map.\n\nWe're adding a few more **leaflet** functions.\n\n* `addProviderTiles()` - instead of `addTiles()`\n    * Uses the Leaflet Providers plugin to add [different tiles](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) to map\n* `setView()` - sets the starting position of the map\n    * Centers it on defined coordinates with a specific zoom level\n* Lots of arguments passed to `addPolygons()`\n    * `fillColor()`\n    * `fillOpacity()`\n    * `weight`\n    * `smoothFactor()`\n* `addLegend()` - same as in the previous section but with more customization\n\n```{r starbucks_map, warning=F, message=F}\n# Mapping it with the new tiles CartoDB.Positron\nleaflet() %>%\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.Positron\") %>%\n  setView(-98.483330, 38.712046, zoom = 4) %>% \n  addPolygons(data = counties_merged_annual , \n              fillColor = ~pal(counties_merged_annual$avg_pills_per_person), \n              fillOpacity = 1, \n              weight = 0.9, \n              smoothFactor = 0.2, \n              stroke=TRUE,\n              color=\"white\",\n              popup = ~popup_sb) %>%\n  addLegend(pal = pal, \n            values = counties_merged_annual$avg_pills_per_person, \n            position = \"bottomright\", \n            title = \"Average pills per person\")\n\n\n```\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nBut we can do better!\n\nLike, where's Alaska and Hawaii? We have to do some map dragging to get them in the viewer window.\n\nWhile we're at it, let's pick a new [projection](https://mercator.tass.com/) for the map so it's not so flat. \nAlso, we should add some state borders. \n\nWe're aiming to get this map as close as possible to the [Post's published version](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).\n\nWe'll use a few new packages for dealing with spatial data.\n\n* rmapshaper (an R port of [mapshaper tools](https://mapshaper.org/) that carto nerds love)\n* albersusa (custom tools and shapefiles for \"AlbersUSA\" projections [[link](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/albersusa)])\n\nFor the sake of time, we'll load the shapefiles locally.\n\nBut the code to get the polygon data all within R is in the commented code below.\n\n```{r better_maps}\n#library(sp)\n\n# albersusa is not on CRAN so you need to uncomment \n# the code below and run it to install\n#remotes::install_github(\"hrbrmstr/albersusa\")\n\n#library(albersusa)\n\n#counties_reprojected <- counties_sf()\n#states_reprojected <- usa_sf()\n\ncounties_reprojected <- st_read(\"shapefiles/counties_reprojected.shp\")\nstates_reprojected <- st_read(\"shapefiles/states_reprojected.shp\")\n\nlibrary(rmapshaper)\n\n# simplifying the state borders so they're smaller\nstate_borders <- rmapshaper::ms_simplify(states_reprojected, keep = 0.1)\n```\n\nOkay, let's merge our summarized data with the shapefiles and clean it up a bit.\n\n```{r merge_and_clean, warning=F, message=F}\ncounties_merged_annual_re <- left_join(counties_reprojected, annual_summary, by=c(\"fips\"= \"countyfips\"))\n\n# Getting rid of rows with NA values\n# These are dataframes so we can use filter instead of subset\n\ncounties_merged_annual_re <- filter(counties_merged_annual_re, !is.na(avg_pills_per_person)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(fips))\n```\n\nNow, let's prepare some styles and projections for the map.\n\n```{r styles, warning=F, message=F}\n\n# setting up a color palette depending \n# on the range of numbers in avg_pills_per_person\n# pal <- colorNumeric(\"Reds\", domain = counties_merged_annual$avg_pills_per_person)\n\n# but i'm cheating by setting the ceiling at 150\n# and anything above that will be a darker color \n# that I set up in the NA field\npal <- colorNumeric(\"Reds\", domain =0:150, na.color = \"#640E27\")\n\nlibrary(sp)\n# this sets up some custom projection in leaflet\n# complicated but necessary\nepsg2163 <- leafletCRS(\n  crsClass = \"L.Proj.CRS\",\n  code = \"EPSG:2163\",\n  proj4def = \"+proj=laea +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6370997 +b=6370997 +units=m +no_defs\",\n  resolutions = 2^(16:7))\n```\n\n## Visualizing the reprojected map\n\n```{r reprojected_map, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, warning=F, message=F}\n\nm <- leaflet(counties_merged_annual_re, options = leafletOptions(crs = epsg2163)) %>%\n  addPolygons(data=counties_reprojected, fillOpacity = 1, \n              weight = 0.9, \n              smoothFactor = 0.2, \n              stroke=TRUE,\n              color=\"white\") %>% \n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~pal(avg_pills_per_person), fillOpacity = 1, \n              weight = 0.9, \n              smoothFactor = 0.2, \n              stroke=TRUE,\n              color=\"white\",\n    label = ~paste(BUYER_COUNTY, avg_pills_per_person),\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(direction = \"auto\"))\n\nm\n```\n\nBeautiful!\n\nWe're closer to the final production.\n\nBut we could add some bar charts.\n\nOne hack is to generate charts for each county using annual data and then use html to display them when clicking on a county.\n\nI've already generated those charts in the \"minicharts\" folder for you.\n\nIf you want to see how to programatically generate those charts yourself, I've left that code in the comments below.\n\n```{r loop_code}\n#library(arcos)\n#annual_counties <- summarized_county_annual(key=\"WaPo\")\n#annual_population <- county_population(key = \"WaPo\")\n#annual <- left_join(annual_counties, annual_population)\n#annual <- annual %>% \n#  mutate(pills_per_person=round(DOSAGE_UNIT/population,2))\n\n#annual <- filter(annual, !is.na(countyfips))\n#county_list <-

print(paste0(file_save, \"-\", i, \" of \", length(county_list)))\n#}\n```\n\nOkay, we need to customize our pop up code carefully.\n\n```{r popup_code, eval=F}\n\n# you'll want to replace the img src url\n# with the path to where you host your images\n\npopup_sb <- paste0(\n  \"<strong>\",\n  str_to_title(counties_merged_annual_re$BUYER_COUNTY),\n  \" County</strong></br>\",\n

production or publication. Internally, fine.\n\nIf you want to publish this map, you should code in those bar charts with javascript and css.\n\nHere's a way to do that with this data.\n\nWe need to transform it so that each annual value is its own column, starting with 2006.\n\n```{r annual_wide, warning=F, message=F}\n# import the data\nannual <- read_csv(\"data/annual.csv\")\n\nannual_wide <- annual %>% \n  select(BUYER_COUNTY, BUYER_STATE, countyfips, year, pills_per_person) %>% \n  group_by(BUYER_COUNTY, BUYER_STATE, countyfips) %>% \n  mutate(avg_per_person_per_year=round(mean(pills_per_person, na.rm=T),1),\n         max=max(pills_per_person),\n         min=min(pills_per_person)) %>% \n  spread(year, pills_per_person) %>% \n  mutate(val2006=(`2006`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2007=(`2007`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2008=(`2008`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2009=(`2009`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2010=(`2010`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2011=(`2011`-min)/(max-min)*10,\n         val2012=(`2012`-min)/(max-min)*10\n         ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(countyfips))\n\n## and now the intense css and html part\n\npopup_sb <- paste0('<div class=\"tooltip\" style=\"max-width: 160px;\">\n    <h3>', str_to_title(annual_wide$BUYER_COUNTY), ' County</h3>\n    <p>', annual_wide$avg_per_person_per_year, ' pills per person, per year</p>\n    <div class=\"tooltip-vis-wrap\" style=\"width: 110px;
