This will allow us to change the formats of text in our ggplot2 graphics with html code!\n\nType out or copy and paste all the code in all the gray sections below in your own script or console or run the chunks as they appear in the `ggtext.qmd` file.\n\nLet's load the libraries, import the state-level data and see the structure of the data we've imported.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nstate_df <- read_csv(\"data/opioids_states.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nSeems familiar!\n\nLet's look only at Tennessee.\n\nWe'll use the ggplot2 function `scale_color_manual()` to change the colors of the `geom_line()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- state_df %>% \n  filter(state==\"Tennessee\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, color=type)) +\n    scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(death_per_1m = \"#0072B2\", pills_per_person = \"#D55E00\")\n  ) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +\n  labs(title=\"Rates of opioid purchases and deaths in Tennessee\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Rate\")\n\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggtext_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is fine, but let's try to make it publication-ready.\n\nFirst, let's get rid of the legends at the bottom and incorporate the colors into a subtitle.\n\nAnd we're going to use a function from **ggtext** called [`element_markdown()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/reference/element_markdown.html) within the `theme()` function from **ggplot2**.\n\nIt's an alternative to `element_text()` which is the usual way to modify how the text is rendered in a plot-- like font and height and color. but `element_markdown()` adds oomph to it. This will allow us to pass html code into the text and have it rendered!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- state_df %>% \n  filter(state==\"Tennessee\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, color=type)) +\n    scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(death_per_1m = \"#0072B2\", pills_per_person = \"#D55E00\"),\n    guide=\"none\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # don't need this anymore\n  # theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n# This is new: element_markdown()\n  theme(\n    text= element_text(family = \"Times\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title= element_markdown(size=11, lineheight = 1.2)\n  ) +\n# Everything can go into title along with html code\n  labs(title = \"<strong>Rates of opioid purchases and deaths in Tennessee</strong><br>\n<span style = 'font-size:10pt;'>The annual increase in the sale of <span style = 'color:#0072B2;'>opioid pills per person</span> corresponded with the increase <br />in <span style = 'color:#D55E00;'>overdose deaths per million residents</span> until 2011 when sales declined while deaths kept increasing.\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Rate\")\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggtext_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- state_df %>% \n  filter(state==\"Tennessee\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, color=type)) +\n    scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(death_per_1m = \"#0072B2\", pills_per_person = \"#D55E00\"),\n    guide=\"none\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line() +\n  # don't need this anymore\n  # theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n# This is new: element_markdown()\n  theme(\n    text= element_text(family = \"Times\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title= element_markdown(size=11, lineheight = 1.2)\n  ) +\n# Everything can go into title along with html code\n  labs(title = \"<strong>Rates of opioid purchases and deaths in Tennessee</strong><br>\n<span style = 'font-size:10pt;'>The annual increase in the sale of <span style = 'color:#0072B2;'>opioid pills per person</span> corresponded with the increase <br />in <span style = 'color:#D55E00;'>overdose deaths per million residents</span> until 2011 when sales declined while deaths kept increasing.\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Rate\",\n       caption= \"Data: CDC and The Washington Post DEA ARCOS api\"\n  ) +\n  geom_richtext(aes(x=2012, y=80, \n                    #lineheight=.5,\n                    angle = -10,\n                    label=\"<span style = 'font-size:8pt'>\n                    In 2012, Tennessee lawmakers<br/> \n                    began passing legislation to address <br />\n                    prescription drug abuse.</span>\")) \np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggtext_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExcellent!\n\nBe sure to check out the [documentation](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/index.html) for a few other commands!\n",
